   <p>
       Nahomie’s family is from Puerto Rico and have always wanted to come to the states.
       When she was younger, her family sold as much of their property as they could to be able to make the move,
       but due to some obstacles in the way it did not happen. Two years later her family tried to move again, but
       sadly it did not end up working out. Finally during her senior year of high school she received a scholarship
       for volleyball here at Georgian Court. With much excitement, she accepted the offer and has had a successful
       volleyball and school career ever since.
